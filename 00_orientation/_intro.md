# Orientation – Math Bites You IRL

Ever had your fitness app swear you ran a five-minute mile just because your phone's GPS glitched for a split second? That kind of "consumer-tech fail" is the theme of this opening part. We'll poke at a short 10-second slice of GPS data—one reading per second—and see what mathematics can reveal about messy real-world measurements.

Throughout these first chapters, we'll reuse the same tiny data set to explore how simple ideas like finite differences help make sense of noisy position logs and how smarter filters hint at smoother answers. Think of it as a warm-up lap before diving into more serious mathematics.

By the end of this orientation, you should have a feel for how the book uses practical missteps—like sloppy GPS readings—to motivate deeper concepts. Math really does bite you in real life, but with the right tools, you can bite back.
