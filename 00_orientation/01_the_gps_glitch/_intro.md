# Chapter 0.1 – The GPS Glitch

Imagine you're jogging with your favorite fitness app, but the GPS suddenly jumps, insisting you teleported a few meters sideways. This orientation chapter uses a short 10‑second GPS log to show how even simple calculations can go wrong without the right mathematical tools. We'll see how raw position data $z(t)$ veers from the true path $x(t)$ and how better methods tame the noise.
