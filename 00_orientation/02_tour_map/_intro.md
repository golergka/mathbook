# Tour Map

Ever had your phone's GPS suddenly freeze when you're trying to hail a ride? That's the kind of small tech fail that inspired this book's orientation chapter. We'll use a short ten-second snippet of GPS data—one reading per second—to give concrete meaning to the abstract math that follows. Throughout Part 0, "math bites you irl" remains our theme.

This chapter offers a bird's-eye tour of the three mathematical quests we tackle later: symmetry, infinity, and randomness. Each of the next sections sketches why these ideas matter and how simple tools can demystify them. No heavy proofs here—just an overview so you can see the road ahead.
