## Mini-Hook
Your phone's map app once sent you in endless circles when trying to find a coffee shop. The **10â€‘second GPS log** in `datasets/gps_10s_1hz.csv` shows jitter that confuses the app, making it look like you're walking a crazy loop.

## Intuition
Infinity isn't just about large numbersâ€”it often shows up when a process refuses to settle down. Picture that looping GPS trail: each noisy step adds a bit of extra distance, and in theory you could keep counting steps forever. We'll see how mathematics tames those spirals.

## Formal Core
We'll explore how sequences $(a_n)$ describe an unfolding process and how their sums $S_N=\sum_{n=1}^N a_n$ can approach a limit. If the partial sums get closer and closer to some value $S$, we say the series converges. Otherwise, the total distance can blow up just like our malfunctioning map app.

## Worked Problems
### ðŸŒ± Starter
Using `gps_10s_1hz.csv`, compute the straight-line displacement from start to end:
1. Convert latitude and longitude to meters (approx. 111,000 meters per degree).
2. Subtract the first coordinates from the last to get $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$.
3. Distance $\approx \sqrt{\Delta x^2+\Delta y^2} \approx 1.2$ meters.

### ðŸŒ³ Intermediate
Estimate the path length if you naively connect each GPS dot:
1. Compute differences between successive lat/lon pairs.
2. Convert to meters and sum the segment lengths.
3. Because of jitter, this "polyline" is about 5 metersâ€”much longer than the real displacement, hinting at an infinite zigzag if we kept collecting data.

## Meta-Reflection
This glimpse of runaway path length foreshadows topics like series convergence ðŸ“ˆ and even chaos in dynamical systems. Later chapters will give you the tools to decide when adding up infinitely many jittery steps actually makes sense.
