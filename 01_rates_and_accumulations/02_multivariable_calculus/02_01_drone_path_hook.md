## Mini-Hook

A hobbyist drone (mass $1\,$kg, battery $50\,$Wh) has to travel from point A to point B with a steady crosswind of $2\,$m/s. If it simply flies straight, the battery might drain before it reaches the destination. How can a smarter path save precious energy?

## Intuition

Imagine a paper airplane gliding across a breeze. The wind nudges it off course, so you tilt your throw to compensate. For a drone, we have motors and sensors to correct the drift. But constant corrections waste battery. Instead, we want a path that naturally rides the wind when possible. By treating the droneâ€™s energy usage like a gentle slope to roll down, we can let calculus guide the way.

## Formal Core

We define an energy cost functional $E[\gamma]$ for a path $\gamma(t)$ with velocity $\dot\gamma(t)$. In still air, energy roughly scales like the square of speed. A wind vector $\mathbf{w}=(2,0,0)\,$m/s modifies the effective velocity to $\dot\gamma(t)-\mathbf{w}$. The goal is to minimize
$$E[\gamma]=\int_0^T \|\dot\gamma(t)-\mathbf{w}\|^2\,dt$$
subject to $\gamma(0)=A$ and $\gamma(T)=B$. Gradient descent on this functional gives a vector field guiding the drone toward an efficient path. The key idea is to treat $E$ as a surface in a high-dimensional space; a small change in $\gamma$ creates a slope along which we can descend to a lower-energy route.

## Worked Problems

### ðŸŒ± Starter: Straight-Line Guess

**Problem.** With no wind, a drone travels $100\,$m in $20\,$s along a straight line. Estimate the energy cost if $E[\gamma]$ reduces to $\int \|\dot\gamma(t)\|^2 dt$ and the drone maintains constant speed.

**Solution.** A straight line means constant speed $v=100/20=5\,$m/s. The integrand $\|\dot\gamma(t)\|^2$ equals $v^2=25$. Over $20\,$s, the cost is $\int_0^{20} 25\,dt=25\times20=500$ (in whatever units our model uses). Even this simple model shows how speed squared dominates energy use.

### ðŸŒ³ Intermediate: First Descent Step

**Problem.** Now include a wind $\mathbf{w}=(2,0,0)$. Starting from the straight-line path $\gamma_0(t)$, compute the variation $\delta E$ for a small deviation $\eta(t)$ with $\eta(0)=\eta(T)=0$. Show how the gradient descent update arises.

**Solution.** Write $\gamma=\gamma_0+\epsilon\eta$. Then
$$E[\gamma]=\int_0^T \|\dot\gamma_0+\epsilon\dot\eta-\mathbf{w}\|^2 dt.$$
Expanding and keeping terms up to first order in $\epsilon$ gives
$$E[\gamma]=E[\gamma_0]+2\epsilon\int_0^T (\dot\gamma_0-\mathbf{w})\cdot\dot\eta\,dt +O(\epsilon^2).$$
Integrating by parts and using $\eta(0)=\eta(T)=0$ yields
$$\delta E=2\epsilon\int_0^T -\ddot\gamma_0\cdot\eta\,dt.$$
Thus the functional gradient is $-2\ddot\gamma_0$. A descent step updates the path by moving opposite this gradient, nudging $\gamma$ toward a curve whose acceleration balances the wind.

## Meta-Reflection

This section hints at how multivariable calculus tackles optimization in the wild ðŸ“ˆ. We treated a drone path as a curve to tweak, a perspective that returns in gradient/gradient-descent methods. Upcoming sections dive deeper into vector calculus tools for understanding and controlling motion in multiple dimensions. Farther ahead weâ€™ll revisit the drone with more advanced models (think differential equations and control theory). For now, keep an eye on how gradients quietly shape efficient motion.
