## Mini-Hook

Ever tried to estimate how fast a pandemic is spreading when you only have day-by-day infection counts? It's like judging the speed of a car by only peeking every 24 hours. Let's see how short numerical bursts can help us approximate that speed and smooth out the noise in real-world data.

## Intuition

Before diving into formulas, picture our daily COVID case counts as dots on a curve. The slope between any two dots hints at how fast cases are rising or falling. But real data is messyâ€”weekends, reporting delays, and sudden spikes all jitter the curve. Numerical differentiation is a way to estimate slopes when perfect, smooth functions aren't handy. Think of it as drawing tiny secant lines between close-by points to approximate the true tangent.

Our Starter scenario uses raw daily counts: we'll compute simple differences to get a crude slope. The Level-Up version refines this by fitting a logistic curve and using centered differences, giving a smoother estimate of the rate of infection growth.

## Formal Core

**Definition 1.6.1 (Forward Difference).** For a discrete sequence $f_0,f_1,\ldots,f_n$ sampled at uniform intervals of width $h$, the *forward difference* at point $i$ is
$$\Delta f_i = \frac{f_{i+1}-f_i}{h}.$$
*Why care?* It provides a first, quick estimate of the derivative using the next data point.

**Definition 1.6.2 (Centered Difference).** A more accurate estimate uses both neighbors:
$$\delta f_i = \frac{f_{i+1}-f_{i-1}}{2h}.$$
*Why care?* Centered differences cancel some of the noise and give second-order accuracy.

**Theorem 1.6.3 (Error Bound).** If $f$ has a continuous third derivative on $[a,b]$, the error in a centered difference approximation satisfies
$$|f'(x_i)-\delta f_i| \le \frac{h^2}{6}\max_{x\in[a,b]}|f'''(x)|.$$
*Why care?* Knowing how the error scales with $h$ helps choose a good step size when balancing accuracy and noise.

## Worked Problems

### ðŸŒ± Starter â€“ Raw Differences
Using `/datasets/covid_daily_cases.csv`, suppose we have daily case counts `c(t)` for March 1â€“10, 2020:

```
Date,Cases
2020-03-01,35
2020-03-02,43
2020-03-03,55
2020-03-04,70
2020-03-05,98
2020-03-06,150
2020-03-07,210
2020-03-08,250
2020-03-09,300
2020-03-10,370
```

1. Compute the forward differences with $h=1$ day.
2. Identify the day with the fastest increase.

**Solution.**
1. Differences:
   - March 2: $(43-35)/1 = 8$ cases/day
   - March 3: $(55-43)/1 = 12$ cases/day
   - March 4: $(70-55)/1 = 15$ cases/day
   - March 5: $(98-70)/1 = 28$ cases/day
   - March 6: $(150-98)/1 = 52$ cases/day
   - March 7: $(210-150)/1 = 60$ cases/day
   - March 8: $(250-210)/1 = 40$ cases/day
   - March 9: $(300-250)/1 = 50$ cases/day
   - March 10: $(370-300)/1 = 70$ cases/day
2. The biggest jump is on March 10 with an estimated rate of 70 cases/day.

### ðŸŒ³ Intermediate â€“ Centered Logistic Fit
Now fit a logistic model $c(t)=\frac{k}{1+Ae^{-rt}}$ with $r=0.25$, $k=100000$, and choose points spaced two days apart for better smoothing. With the same data window, compute the centered difference around March 5.

**Solution.**
1. Evaluate the fitted curve at March 3, 5, and 7:
   - $c(3)\approx\frac{100000}{1+Ae^{-0.75}}$
   - $c(5)\approx\frac{100000}{1+Ae^{-1.25}}$
   - $c(7)\approx\frac{100000}{1+Ae^{-1.75}}$
   For brevity, assume these give $c(3)=1000$, $c(5)=1500$, $c(7)=2300$ cases (illustrative numbers).
2. Using $h=2$ days,
$$\delta c(5) = \frac{2300-1000}{4} = 325\text{ cases/day}.$$
3. This rate is smoother than the raw difference around March 5 and better reflects the logistic trend rather than daily noise.

## Meta-Reflection

Numerical differentiation bridges the gap between pure calculus and real data. We've turned scattered daily counts into a sense of *velocity*â€”how fast cases growâ€”without diving into exact formulas. In the next chapter on multivariable calculus ðŸ“ˆ, these ideas extend to gradients that guide a drone through blustery winds. If the raw differences here felt jittery, keep an eye out for upcoming chapters on numerical methods ðŸ”§ where stable algorithms tame even noisier situations.
