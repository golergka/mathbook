## Why this part matters

We live in a world awash with changing numbersâ€”from daily infection counts to the charge levels in a droneâ€™s battery. "Rates" tell us how fast those numbers change, while "accumulations" describe the totals they build up over time. By understanding both, we get a powerful lens on growth, decay, and everything in between.

This part uses a real dataset from `/datasets/covid_daily_cases.csv`. Each line has a `date` and a `cases` count for that day between March and October 2020. Weâ€™ll learn how to smooth the noisy daily figures, differentiate them to see trends, and finally integrate them to estimate total infections.

## Escalation road map

1. **Raw counts**: Weâ€™ll start by plotting the daily numbers as they come.
2. **Derivative smoothing**: Next, weâ€™ll look at how moving averages and logistic models sharpen the picture.
3. **Integrals**: Finally, summing up the smoothed curve reveals the cumulative impact.

Along the way weâ€™ll peek at logistic growth fits ($r=0.25,\ K=10^5$) and see how simple derivatives and integrals capture the story in the data. No prior knowledge of calculus is assumedâ€”each chapter builds from scratch.

Get ready to explore how ideas of change and accumulation apply far beyond pandemicsâ€”into physics, finance, and everyday tech.
